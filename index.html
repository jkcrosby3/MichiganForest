  <p>Nearly all of Michigan's forests were cut or burned during European settlement (Dickman and Leefers 2003). The lumber boom and fires occurred in the 1800s and early 1900s.  
By 1920 logging had subsided and Michigan's forests could began a recovery period.  To keep track of the status and trends of the forest, inventory was taken in 1935 and periodically thereafter.
Annual Inventory began in 1999 and is divided over a 5 year period to get a full analysis of a the forests in Michigan.</p>
