The U.S. Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the Northern Research Station conducts inventory on an annual basis, completing 20% of an area in a year's timeframe, completing inventory every five years. The annual inventory started in 1999.
Currently Michigan has over 20 million acres of forest land (forest land + timberland) (Table 1), an increase of 6% since 2004. The forest land has increased by 1 million acres. Along with this increase is an increase in total number of trees, volume, and biomass. The net growth has taken a huge plunge of 33%, which is due, in part, to mortality of Ash and American beech (Fagus grandifolia), due to ash borer (EAB, Argrilius planipennis Fairmaire) and beech bark disease (Cryptococus fagisuga and Neonectria) ([Michigan Forest Health](https://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/docs/fhh/MI_FHH_2008.pdf)). Removals of live trees has a tremendous increase of 314%. The mortality of trees on forestland shows a disturbing 26% increase over this time span.
