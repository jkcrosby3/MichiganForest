				<h2 >Michigan Forest Land and Timberland by Year</h2>

				<h4>
				Michigan is covered by 54% forests.  Timberland accounts for 95 percent of this forest land or 19.3 million acres, and is increasing annually, 
				almost 1 million acres from 2004 to 2017, a 5% increase. Nearly 4 percent of forest land is reserved from timber production and 1 percent is other forest land 
				identified as not being able to meet minimum productivity standards. Forest land has experienced an inrease of 58,500 acres, a 6% increase. 
				Michigan's total area is 37.4 million acres (land and water, excluding Great Lakes).

				<h4>Stand-Size</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>The number of sawtimber-size (9.0 inches d.b.h. for softwoods, 11.0 inches d.b.h. for hardwoods) trees increased by 31 percent.
				<li>The number of poletimber-size trees decreased by 17 percent.  
				<li>The number of saplings (1 to less than 5 inches d.b.h.) decreased by 2% percent.
				</ul>

				<h4>Age</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>50 percent of all stands are between 51-85 years old.
				<li>32 percent of timberland area is younger.  
				<li>6 percent of timberland area is over 100 years old.  
				<li>Acreage has increased in stands from 16-25 and 66-100+ years old and decreased in stands from 0-15 and 26-65 years old.

				<h4>
				<h1>What does this mean?</h1>
				Michigan's forestland base has remained relatively stable
				<ul>
				<li>Losses in forest due to conversions or mortality but stable.
				<li>Current forest stand-size and age-class distributions indicate maturing forest, 
				but still have young stands with 22 percent less than 40 years old.  
				<li>Trend in maturing forests look to continue.
				</ul>
