**Forest Area**

**Michigan Forest Land and Timberland by Year**

Michigan is covered by 54% forests.  Timberland accounts for 95 percent of this forest land or 19.3 million acres, and is increasing annually, almost 1 million acres from 2004 to 2017, a 5% increase. Nearly 4 percent of forest land is reserved from timber production and 1 percent is other forest land identified as not being able to meet minimum productivity standards. Forest land has experienced an inrease of 58,500 acres, a 6% increase. Michigan's total area is 37.4 million acres (land and water, excluding Great Lakes).

**Forest Ownership - Michigan 2017- map chart if possible, otherwise  pie chart**

Families and individuals, corporations, and other private entities own the majority of forest land (61.8%), with the amount slowly increasing yearly, 643,000 acres since 2004, or 5%. The State of Michigan, U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service, and other federal groups own the remainder (23.1%, 13.6%, 1.5%, respectively).

**Timberland by stand-size class and year - Michigan**

The forests have been maturing, as seen by the distribution of stand-size classes.  

***Stand-Size  |  2004-2017***

##The number of sawtimber-size (9.0 inches d.b.h. for softwoods, 11.0 inches d.b.h. for hardwoods) trees increased by 31 percent.
##The number of poletimber-size trees decreased by 17 percent.  
##The number of saplings (1 to less than 5 inches d.b.h.) decreased by 2% percent.

***Age***

##50 percent of all stands are between 51-85 years old.
##32 percent of timberland area is younger.  
##6 percent of timberland area is over 100 years old.  
##Acreage has increased in stands from 16-25 and 66-100+ years old and decreased in stands from 0-15 and 26-65 years old.

**What does this mean?**
				
Michigan's forestland base has remained relatively stable

##Losses in forest due to conversions or mortality but stable.
##Current forest stand-size and age-class distributions indicate maturing forest, but still have young stands with 22 percent less than 40 years old.  
##Trend of maturing forests looks to continue.
